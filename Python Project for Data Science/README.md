During IBM Python Project for Data Science i learned how to work with data, how to use Webscraping and retrive tables i need. 
I worked with financial data using yfinance and web scraping with BeautifulSoup. 
I extracted and analyzed historical stock data for companies like Tesla and GameStop,
processed revenue tables, and visualized the data using Python libraries such as pandas and plotly.
